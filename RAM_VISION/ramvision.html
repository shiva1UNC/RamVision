    Ram Vision was created by two UNC CS undergrads, Shiva Kammala and Edward Baker.
    The website is intended to help students navigate which classes to choose and provide
    some statistics on how students have done historically for a given class.

    Ram Vision operates on an Honor Code system. When submitting a grade for a class
    we ask you to please be honest. The accuracy of the website and the usefullness 
    depends on students telling the truth. All submissions are anonymous and your personal
    info will never be shared with anyone.
